EscortWarn is an addon for World of Warcraft Classic.

EscortWarn will open a prompt when you are about to accept an escort quest.
Escort quests in WoW Classic start as soon as you accept the quest so it is important that all group members are ready before accepting the quest.

EscortWarn can announce to your group or raid that you are ready to accept the escort quest.

Works well with addons that automatically accept quests so that you don't start an escort before your group is ready.
